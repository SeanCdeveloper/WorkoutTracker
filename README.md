# WorkoutTracker

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view, create, and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.  This application allows a user to track their fitness levels 


## Utilizing the APP

The user is routed to an Workout-Tracker page, where they enter in exercise-related information based on resistance or cardio exercises.  After they enter in that information, they can either enter a second exercise -- by pressing the "Add New Exercise" button -- or enter just one exercise -- by pressing the "Complete" button.  The app will automatically tally up the total duration, weight, reps, sets, and distance of the completed exercises.   Once back on the home page, the user can then add a new exercise to the previous exercise or start a new workout. 

If the user clicks on the "Dashboard" tab in the navigation bar, they will be brought to a "Workout Dashboard", where they can view analytics pertaining to their workout presented through a line chart, bar chart, pie chart, and donut chart.  

The line chart displays the workout duration, in minutes, of each exercise entered.  The bar chart displays the total the total pounds lifted during each exercise.  The pie chart displays the percentage of time spent on each exercise by duration.  The donut chart displays the percentage of time spent on each exercise by weight.
